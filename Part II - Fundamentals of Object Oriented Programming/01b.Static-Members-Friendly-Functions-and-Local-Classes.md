## Static Data Members and Functions

Both data members and member functions of a class can be static. 

#### Static Data Members (class variables)
Data members of a class can be qualified as ```static``` members, and they will have the following properties:

* Initialized to zero, when the first object of that class is created. No other initialization permitted.
* Only one copy of the member is created for the entire class, and shared by all objects of the class.
* Visible only within the class, but it's lifetime is the entire program.

Static members are normally used to maintain values common to the entire class, e.g. a static member that records the occurences of all objects. For example,

```C++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class item
{

  int tagNum;
  char serviceTag[10];
  static int countObjects;
  
  public:
  void putData();
  void getData(int number, char tagValue);
  void printCount();
  
};

int item::countObjects;        

void item :: getData(int number, char tagValue)
{
  tagNum = number;
  strcpy(serviceTag, tagValue);
  count++;
  putData();
}

void item :: putData()
{
  cout << "Tag Num:" << tagNum << "Service Tag:" << serviceTag;
}

void item :: printCount()
{
  cout << "Number of Objects:" << countObjects;
}

int main()
{

  item item1;
  item1.getData(302120, "WERSEC123");
  item1.printCount();                     //1 
  
  item item2;
  item2.getData(302121, "WERSEC124");
  item2.printCount();                     //2
  
  item item3;
  item3.getData(302122, "WERSEC125");
  item3.printCount();                     //3
  
  return 0;
}

```

The type and scope of each static member must be outside the class, this is necessary because static data members are stored seperatly than as a part of an object. 
Since they are associated with the class itself rather than class object - they are called as class variables. 

When defining a static variable some initial value can be assigned, (but not during it's declaration inside the class) for instance:

```C++
int item :: countObjects = 10;         // assigns an initial value of 10 to countObjects
```

#### Static Member Functions

## Local Classes

A class which has been defined inside a function, thereby having only function scope is called as a local class. Local classes are not typically used, as they have certain limitations on the type of data and functions they can have as members. For a local class:

* Objects can only be created within the function in which it is defined.
* All member functions must be defined within the class
* It is possible to:
    * have static member functions, but not static data members
    * access global variables (using :: operator) and global functions
    * access static variables, enum constants of the enclosing function, but not local variables of the function
    * access other local classes enclosed within the function

```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int softwareVersion = 31265;                          // global variable

void rectangleAreaPerimeter(float ln, float br)
{

  int operationCount = 0;
  static char unit = 'm';
  
  class Calculate
  {
     float area;
     float perimeter;
     
     public:
     void calculateArea(float l, float b)
     {
       area = l * b;
       operationCount++;              // illegal, local variable cannot be accessed by member functions of a local class
     }
     
     void calculatePerimeter(float l, float b)
     {
       perimeter = 2 * (l + b);
     }
     
     void print()
     {
       cout << "Area: " << area << "sq" << units 
            << "Perimeter: " << perimeter << unit;      // static variables of the enclosing function can be accessed
     }
    
    static void printSoftwareVersion()                  // allowed to have static member functions
    {
      cout << "SoftwareVersion" << ::softwareVersion << "\n";            // global variables can be accessed
    }
    
  };
 
  Calculate AreaPerimeter;
 
  AreaPerimeter.calculateArea(ln,br);
  AreaPerimeter.calculatePerimeter(ln,br);
  AreaPerimeter.print();
  Calculate::printSoftwareVersion();
 
 }

int main()
{

  float length = 1.2;
  float breadth = 1.2;
  
  Calculate AreaPerimeter;                 // invalid, local class not visible in this scope
  Calculate *AreaPrmtrPtr;                 // invalid, local class not visible in this scope
  
  rectangleAreaPerimeter(length, breadth);
  return 0;
}

```
