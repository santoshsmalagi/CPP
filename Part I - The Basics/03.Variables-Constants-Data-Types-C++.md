## Tokens in C++
The smallest individual units in a program are known as tokens. C++ has the following tokens: 

* Keywords
  * words which are explicitly reserved for a specific purpose and cannot be used as normal identifier names in a C++ program
      * e.g. ```auto, break, continue, for, while, if, else, return, switch etc.```
* Identifiers
  * Identifiers refer to the names of variables, functions, arrays, classes, etc.
  * Rules for naming identifiers:
    * Only alphabetic characters, digits and underscores are permitted
    * The name cannot start with a digit
    * Uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct
    * A declared keyword cannot be used as a variable name.
    * While ANSI C recognizes only the first 32 characters in a name, ANSI C++ places no limit on its length, therefore all characters are significant
* Constants
  * Constants refer to fixed values that do not change during program exeuction
  * C++ supports several constants - char (char, backslash char, wchar_t), integer (decimal, octal, hexadecimal), real constants, string constants etc.
* Strings
* Operators

#### Reserved Keywords and Predefined Identifiers
* Some keywords that one might "expect" to be reserved keywords words, just are not. The keyword ```main``` is a prime example, others include things like the ```endl``` manipulator and other keywords from the vast collection of C++ libraries. 
* For example, one can declare a variable called main inside main function, initialize it, and then print out its value. 
* On the other hand, this is not possible with a variable named else. 
* The difference is that ```else``` is a reserved word, while ```main``` is "only" a predefined identifier. 
* Here is a short list of some of the predefined identifiers in C++:
    * ```cin```
    * ```endl```
    * ```INT_MIN```
    * ```iomanip```
    * ```main```
    * ```npos```
    * ```std```
    * ```cout```
    * ```include```
    * ```INT_MAX```
    * ```iostream```
    * ```MAX_RAND```
    * ```NULL```
    * ```string```
   
**Compound Statement**
A compound statement is a group of statements (each of them terminated by its own semicolon), but all grouped together in a block, and enclosed in curly braces:

```C++
{ 
statement1; 
statement2; 
statement3; 
}
```
   
## Data Types in C++
Both C and C++ compilers support all the built-in (also known as basic or fundamental) data types.

With the exception of void, the basic data types may have several modifiers preceding them to serve the needs of various situations. The modifiers signed, unsigned, long, and short may be applied to character and integer basic data types. However, the modifier long may also be applied to double. Data type representation is machine specific in C++. ANSI C++ committee has added two more data types, bool and wchar_t.
