# Programming Paradigms
Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. A paradigm is a model or a framework for describing how a program handles data. There are several possible programming paradigms, the major ones are:

* **Procedural (or imperative) Paradigm**
  * Problem is viewed as a sequence of procedures
* **Object-Oriented Paradigm**
  * Approach that provides a way of modularizing programs by creating partitioned memory area for both data and functions, and can be used as a template for creating copies of such modules on demand.
* **Functional Paradigm**
  * Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions 
* **Logical Paradigm**
  * Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules, an engine infers answers to questions

> *Many programming languages cannot be strictly classified into one paradigm, but rather include features from several paradigms.*

# Procedural (Imperative) Paradigm

# Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm

> *A language is said to support a style of programming if it provides facilities that make it convenient (reasonably easy, safe, and efficient) to use that style. A language does not support a technique if it takes exceptional effort or skill to write such programs; it merely enables the technique to be used. For example, it is possible to write structured programs in FORTRAN and Object-Oriented programs in C, but it is unnecessarily hard to do so because these languages do not directly support those techniques.*

## Common programming languages and paradigms supported by them:

* **C** - mostly an imperative or procedural programming language, but can implement OOP concepts (which is not very efficient)
* **C++** - mostly intended as an object-oriented programming language, though C++ programs can also be written in pure procedural paradigm
* **Python** - supports imperative, functional, procedural, and object-oriented programming
* **Shell-Scripting** - though shell-scripting does not really fall into the category of mainstream programming languages (it is a scripting language), it is imperative or procedural programming
* **Tcl** - supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles.
