## 1. Static Data Members and Functions

Both data members and member functions of a class can be static. 

### Static Data Members (class variables)
Data members of a class can be qualified as ```static``` members, and they will have the following properties:

* Initialized to zero, when the first object of that class is created. No other initialization permitted.
* Only one copy of the member is created for the entire class, and shared by all objects of the class.
* Visible only within the class, but it's lifetime is the entire program.

Static members are normally used to maintain values common to the entire class, e.g. a static member that records the occurences of all objects. For example,

```C++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class item
{

  int tagNum;
  char serviceTag[10];
  static int countObjects;
  
  public:
  void putData();
  void getData(int number, char tagValue);
  void printCount();
  
};

int item::countObjects;        

void item :: getData(int number, char tagValue)
{
  tagNum = number;
  strcpy(serviceTag, tagValue);
  count++;
  putData();
}

void item :: putData()
{
  cout << "Tag Num:" << tagNum << "Service Tag:" << serviceTag;
}

void item :: printCount()
{
  cout << "Number of Objects:" << countObjects;
}

int main()
{

  item item1;
  item1.getData(302120, "WERSEC123");
  item1.printCount();                     //1 
  
  item item2;
  item2.getData(302121, "WERSEC124");
  item2.printCount();                     //2
  
  item item3;
  item3.getData(302122, "WERSEC125");
  item3.printCount();                     //3
  
  return 0;
}

```

The type and scope of each static member must be outside the class, this is necessary because static data members are stored seperatly than as a part of an object. 
Since they are associated with the class itself rather than class object - they are called as class variables. 

When defining a static variable some initial value can be assigned, (but not during it's declaration inside the class) for instance:

```C++
int item :: countObjects = 10;         // assigns an initial value of 10 to countObjects
```

### Static Member Functions

A member function which has been declared as has the following properties:

* can only access static data members or other static member functions of the class
* it can be called using the class name instead of the class object, i.e. both of the following formats are supported:
  * ```class-name :: static-member-function();```
  * ```class-object.static-member-function()```

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Students
{
    private:
        static int numStudents;
        string name;
        string rollNum;

    public:
        void getData()
        {
            cout << "Enter the Student Name: \n";
            cin >> name;
            cout << "Enter Roll Number: \n";
            cin >> rollNum;
            numStudents++;
        }

        void putData()
        {
            cout << "Student: " << name << "Roll Number:" << rollNum << "\n";
        }

        static void showCount()
        {
            cout << "Number of Students: " << numStudents << "\n";
        }

};

int Students::numStudents;

int main()
{
    Students student1,student2;
    student1.getData();
    Students::showCount();
    student2.getData();
    Students::showCount();

    return 0;
}

```

## 2. const Member Functions

A function which does not alter any data member of a class can be declared as a ```const``` member function by appending the keyword ```const``` to it.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Person
{
    private:
        string name;
        string dateOfBirth;
        int age;

    public:
        void getData();
        void showData() const;

};

void Person::getData()
{
    cout << "Name: ";
    std::getline(std::cin, name);
    cout << "Date of Birth (ddmmyyyy): ";
    std::getline(std::cin,dateOfBirth);
    cout <<"Age: ";
    cin >> age;
}

void Person::showData() const
{

    cout << "Name: " << name << "\n";
    cout << "Date of Birth: " << "\n";
    cout << "Age: " << age;
}

int main()
{

    Person P;
    P.getData();
    P.showData();

    return 0;
}
```



## 3. Friend Functions

Certain situations may warrant that the private data members of a class be accessible by non-member functions, such a function is then declared as a *friend* of that class. A friend function has the following salient features:

* Unlike member functions of a class, it cannot directly access the private data members of a class. Access to private data members (also member functions) is possible through a class object and using the dot operator. 
* A friend need not be a member of the class
* A function can be declared as a friend to any number of classes
* A friend function is not in the scope of the class where it has been declared as a friend, hence it cannot be called using the objects of that class
* It is invoked like a normal function
* A non-member function can be declared as a friend to a class either in the public or private sections of a class, without altering it's meaning.
* Friend functions are mostly used during operator overloading, and operations that are conducted between two different classes accessing private or protected members of both. 

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Person
{
    private:
       string name;
       int age;
       string dateofBirth;
       friend void showData(Person P);

    public:
        void getData(string str, int x, string dob)
        {
            name = str;
            age = x;
            dateofBirth = dob;
        }
};

void showData(Person P)
{
    cout << "Name: " << P.name << " age: " << P.age << " DOB: " << P.dateofBirth;
}

int main()
{
    Person P;
    P.getData("Santosh", 28, "09101991");
    showData(P);

    return 0;
}
```

### Function Friendly to Two Classes
Member functions of one class can be friend functions of another class, all member functions of a class A can be made as the friend functions of another class B by declaring it as a **friend class**. In the below example, class Rectangle is a friend of class Square allowing Rectangle's member functions to access private and protected members of Square. 

```C++
include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Square;

class Rectangle {
    int width, height;
  public:
    int area ()
      {return (width * height);}
    void convert (Square a);
};

class Square {
  friend class Rectangle;
  private:
    int side;
  public:
    Square (int a) : side(a) {}
};

void Rectangle::convert (Square a) {
  width = a.side;
  height = a.side;
}
  
int main () {
  Rectangle rect;
  Square sqr (4);
  rect.convert(sqr);
  cout << rect.area();
  return 0;
}
```

Friendships are never corresponded unless specified: In our example, Rectangle is considered a friend class by Square, but Square is not considered a friend by Rectangle. Therefore, the member functions of Rectangle can access the protected and private members of Square but not the other way around. Of course, Square could also be declared friend of Rectangle, if needed, granting such an access. Another property of friendships is that they are not transitive: The friend of a friend is not considered a friend unless explicitly specified.

## 4. Forward Class Declaration
A forward class declaration (similar to forward declaration of functions, variables, and other user-defined types) informs the compiler about the existence of a class even before it is used.

```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// forward class declaration
class A;
class B;

class B
{
    private:
        int x;
    public:
        void getdata()
        {
            cout << "x: ";
            cin >> x;
        }
        friend void showData();
};

class A
{
    private:
        int y;
    public:
        void getData()
        {
            cout << "y: ";
            cin >> y;
        }
        friend void showData();
};

void showData()
{
    A a;
    B b;

    a.getData();
    b.getdata();

    cout << "A::y = " << a.y << " B::b = " << b.x;
}

int main()
{
    showData();
    return 0;
}
```

## 5. Local Classes

A class which has been defined inside a function, thereby having only function scope is called as a local class. Local classes are not typically used, as they have certain limitations on the type of data and functions they can have as members. For a local class:

* Objects can only be created within the function in which it is defined.
* All member functions must be defined within the class
* It is possible to:
    * have static member functions, but not static data members
    * access global variables (using :: operator) and global functions
    * access static variables, enum constants of the enclosing function, but not local variables of the function
    * access other local classes enclosed within the function

```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int softwareVersion = 31265;                          // global variable

void rectangleAreaPerimeter(float ln, float br)
{

  int operationCount = 0;
  static char unit = 'm';
  
  class Calculate
  {
     float area;
     float perimeter;
     
     public:
     void calculateArea(float l, float b)
     {
       area = l * b;
       operationCount++;              // illegal, local variable cannot be accessed by member functions of a local class
     }
     
     void calculatePerimeter(float l, float b)
     {
       perimeter = 2 * (l + b);
     }
     
     void print()
     {
       cout << "Area: " << area << "sq" << units 
            << "Perimeter: " << perimeter << unit;      // static variables of the enclosing function can be accessed
     }
    
    static void printSoftwareVersion()                  // allowed to have static member functions
    {
      cout << "SoftwareVersion" << ::softwareVersion << "\n";            // global variables can be accessed
    }
    
  };
 
  Calculate AreaPerimeter;
 
  AreaPerimeter.calculateArea(ln,br);
  AreaPerimeter.calculatePerimeter(ln,br);
  AreaPerimeter.print();
  Calculate::printSoftwareVersion();
 
 }

int main()
{

  float length = 1.2;
  float breadth = 1.2;
  
  Calculate AreaPerimeter;                 // invalid, local class not visible in this scope
  Calculate *AreaPrmtrPtr;                 // invalid, local class not visible in this scope
  
  rectangleAreaPerimeter(length, breadth);
  return 0;
}

```
