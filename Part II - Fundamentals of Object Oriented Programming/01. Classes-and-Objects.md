# Introduction to Classes in C++

## C Structures and their Limitations

Structures in C provide a means to logically group related data items for creating and implementing user-defined types. For example:

```C
struct student
{
  char nameofStudent[20];
  int rollNumber;
  float totalMarks;
};

struct student A;     // declaring a structure

// Accessing member variables
strcpy(A.nameofStudent, "Santosh");
A.rollNumber = 4610212;
totalMarks = 6.5;

```

```struct``` data types in C cannot be treated like built-in types. For example:

```C
struct complex_number
{
  float x;
  float y;
};
  
struct complex_number c1,c2,c3;

c1.x = 1;
c1.y = 0;
c2.x = 0;
c2.y = 1;

c3 = c1 + c2;                  // is illegal
struct complex_number c4;      // correct way to declare struct types in C

c4 = c3;                       // illegal in C
complex_number c4;             // illegal in C, but allowed in C++

```

The other limitations include 
* structures in C do not permit data hiding, structure members can be directly accessed using structure variables by any function in their scope
* structures in C cannot have member functions.

## Extensions to Structures in C++

Structures in C++ are an extension to the C structure, they support all basic capabalities of C structures as well as several additional features:
* to bring user defined types as close as possible to built-in types
  * structure names are stand alone, and can be used like any other type name - keyword ```struct``` can be ommitted in declaration of structure variables
  * example - ```complex_number c4;      //illegal in C, but allowed in C++```
* provide facility to hide data, data can also be declared as ```private``` so that it cannot be accessed by external functions
* support inheritance
* in C++ a structure can have both variables and functions as members

> The only difference between a structure and a class in C++ is that, by default the members of a class are private, while by default the members of a structure are public. Since classes in C++ are a specially introduced data type in C++, classes are used to hold both data and functions, and structures are used to only hold data.

## Classes and Objects
 A class is a way to bind both data and functions together, and create an abstract data type. They are declared using keyword ```class```, whose functionality is similar to that of the C keyword ```struct```, but with the possibility of including functions as members, instead of only data. It takes the following form:

```C++
class class_name
{

  permission_label1:
    variable declarations;
    function declarations;
  permission_label2:
    variable declarations;
    function declarations;
  ...
} object_name;
```

Where *class_name* is a name for the class (user defined type) and the optional field *object_name* is one, or several, valid object identifiers. The body of the declaration can contain members, that can be either data or function declarations, and optionally permission labels, that can be any of these three keywords: ```private```, ```public``` or ```protected```. They make reference to the permission which the following members acquire:

* ```private``` members of a class are accessible only from other members of their same class or from their "friend" classes.
* ```protected``` members are accessible from members of their same class and friend classes, and also from members of their derived classes.
* ```public``` members are accessible from anywhere the class is visible. 

If we declare members of a class before including any permission label, the members are considered private, since it is the default permission that the members of a class acquire. 

* *Data members* - variables declared inside a class
* *Member functions (methods)* - functions declared inside a class

#### Declaring a Class

Simple example of a ```class``` declaration:

```C++
class Rectangle
{

  private:
  float length;
  float breadth;
  
  public:
  void getdata();
  void putdata();
  float area();
  float perimeter();
};
```
The class ```Rectangle```contains two data members, and four member functions. The data members are only accessible by these member functions. 

#### Creating and Instaniating Objects

Once a class has been declared, we can create variables of that type by using the class name just like any other built-in type. For example,

```
Rectangle Rect1;           // memory allocated for object Rect1;
Rectangle Rect1,Rect2;     // more than one objects can also be declared in a single statement
```

Memory for an object is allocated at this stage, a class declaration is more of a template and does not create any memory space for objects. Objects can also be created by placing their names after closing brace:

```C++
class item
{
   int tageNumber;
   char serviceTag[10];
   
   public:
   void getData();
   void setData();
} item1, item2, item3;

```

#### Accessing Members of a Class
#### Accessing public members using the dot operator (.)
#### Local Classes

## Member Functions
### Outside Class Definition
### Inside Class Definition
### Making an Outside Function Inline
### Nesting of Member Functions
### Private Member Functions
## Arrays within Class
## Memory Allocation for Objects
## Static Data Members and Functions
### Static Data Members
### Static Member Functions
## const Member Functions
## Arrays of Objects
## Objects as Function Arguments
## Returning Objects
## Friendly Functions
## Pointers to Members
### Accessing Members Using the Pointer Operator (->)
### this pointer
