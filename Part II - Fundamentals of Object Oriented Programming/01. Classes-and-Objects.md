# Introduction to Classes in C++

## C Structures and their Limitations

Structures in C provide a means to logically group related data items for creating and implementing user-defined types. For example:

```C
struct student
{
  char nameofStudent[20];
  int rollNumber;
  float totalMarks;
};

struct student A;     // declaring a structure

// Accessing member variables
strcpy(A.nameofStudent, "Santosh");
A.rollNumber = 4610212;
totalMarks = 6.5;

```

```struct``` data types in C cannot be treated like built-in types. For example:

```C
struct complex_number
{
  float x;
  float y;
};
  
struct complex_number c1,c2,c3;
c3 = c1 + c2;                  // is illegal
complex_number c4;             // illegal in C, but allowed in C++
struct complex_number c5;      // correct way to declare struct types in C
```

The other limitations include 
* structures in C do not permit data hiding, structure members can be directly accessed using structure variables by any function in their scope
* structures in C cannot have member functions.

## Extensions to Structures in C++

Structures in C++ are an extension to the C structure, they support all basic capabalities of C structures as well as several additional features:
* to bring user defined types as close as possible to built-in types
  * structure names are stand alone, and can be used like any other type name - keyword ```struct``` can be ommitted in declaration of structure variables
  * example - ```complex_number c4;      //illegal in C, but allowed in C++```
* provide facility to hide data, data can also be declared as ```private``` so that it cannot be accessed by external functions
* support inheritance
* in C++ a structure can have both variables and functions as members

> The only difference between a structure and a class in C++ is that, by default the members of a class are private, while by default the members of a structure are public. Since classes in C++ are a specially introduced data type in C++, classes are used to hold both data and functions, and structures are used to only hold data.

## Classes and Objects
 A class is a logical method to organize data and functions in the same structure. They are declared using keyword ```class```, whose functionality is similar to that of the C keyword ```struct```, but with the possibility of including functions as members, instead of only data. It takes the following form:

```C++
class class_name
{

  permission_label_1:
    member1;
  permission_label_2:
    member2;
  ...
} object_name;
```

Where *class_name* is a name for the class (user defined type) and the optional field *object_name* is one, or several, valid object identifiers. The body of the declaration can contain members, that can be either data or function declarations, and optionally permission labels, that can be any of these three keywords: ```private```, ```public``` or ```protected```. They make reference to the permission which the following members acquire:

* private members of a class are accessible only from other members of their same class or from their "friend" classes.
* protected members are accessible from members of their same class and friend classes, and also from members of their derived classes.
* public members are accessible from anywhere the class is visible. 

If we declare members of a class before including any permission label, the members are considered private, since it is the default permission that the members of a class declared with the class keyword acquire.
