# Beginning C++

## Introduction to C++
C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA, in the early 1980’s. The object-oriented features in C++ allow programmers to build large programs with clarity, extensibility and ease of maintenance, incorporating the spirit and efficiency of C. C++ is a versatile language for handling very large programs. It is suitable for virtually any programming task including development of editors, compilers, databases, communication systems and any complex real-life application systems.

A simple C++ program which prints the string "Hello World!" to the STDOUT:

```C++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello World!\n"; 
    return 0;
}
```

Program execution in C++ begins at ```main()```, and every C++ program must have a ```main()```. Apart from a few exceptions the compiler ignores whitespaces and newline characters, and therefore C++ is a free form language. Statements in C++ terminate with a semicolon.

### C++ Comments
C++ comments use a double slash ```//``` though C style comments using ```/* */``` are also valid. one notable difference is that C++ style comments cannot be used within the prgram text. For example,

```C++
for (int i = 0; i < n; // loop n times; n++);         // is invalid
for (int i = 0; i < n; /* loop n tims */; n++);       // is valid  
```

### Ouput and Input Streams
The identifier ```cout``` (pronounced as ‘C out’) is a predefined object that represents the standard output stream in C++. Here, the standard output stream represents the screen. It is also possible to redirect the output to other output devices.  

The operator ```<<``` is called the insertion or put to operator. It inserts (or sends) the contents of the variable on its right to the object on its left. The operator << is the bit-wise left-shift operator and it can still be used for this purpose. This is an example of how one operator can be used for different purposes, depending on the context. This concept is known as operator overloading, an important aspect of polymorphism.

### The iostream file

```C++
#include <iostream>
```
It contains declarations for the identifier cout and the operator ```<<```. Some old versions of C++ use a header file called iostream, header files with ```.h``` extension are “old style” files.  Apart from ```#include```, the other pre-processor directives such as ```#define, #error,``` etc., work the same way as they would in C. But, their usage in C++ is quite limited due to the availability of other means for achieving the same functionality.
