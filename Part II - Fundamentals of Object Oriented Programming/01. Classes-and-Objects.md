# Introduction to Classes in C++

## Structures and their Limitations
## Classes and Objects
 A class is a logical method to organize data and functions in the same structure. They are declared using keyword ```class```, whose functionality is similar to that of the C keyword struct, but with the possibility of including functions as members, instead of only data. It takes the following form:

```C++
class class_name
{

  permission_label_1:
    member1;
  permission_label_2:
    member2;
  ...
} object_name;
```

Where class_name is a name for the class (user defined type) and the optional field object_name is one, or several, valid object identifiers. The body of the declaration can contain members, that can be either data or function declarations, and optionally permission labels, that can be any of these three keywords: private:, public: or protected:. They make reference to the permission which the following members acquire:

* private members of a class are accessible only from other members of their same class or from their "friend" classes.
* protected members are accessible from members of their same class and friend classes, and also from members of their derived classes.
* public members are accessible from anywhere the class is visible. 

If we declare members of a class before including any permission label, the members are considered private, since it is the default permission that the members of a class declared with the class keyword acquire.
