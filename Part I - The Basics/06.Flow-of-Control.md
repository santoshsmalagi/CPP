# Control Structures in C++

All programs can be written in terms of only three control structures - the sequence structure, the selection structure and the repetition structure.

* Sequence Structure
  * The sequence structure is built into C++
  * Unless directed otherwise, C++ statements execute one after the other in the order in which they are written - that is, in sequence.
* Selection Structure
  * C++ provides three types of selection statements - ```if```, ```if-else``` and ```switch```.
  * The ```if``` selection statement is a single-selection statement because it selects or ignores a single action. 
  * The ```if...else``` statement is called a double-selection statement because it selects between two different actions (or groups of actions). 
  * The ```switch``` selection statement is called a multiple-selection statement because it selects among many different actions (or groups of actions).
* Repettion Structure
  * C++ provides three types of repetition statements that enable programs to perform statements repeatedly as long as a condition remains true - ```while```, ```do-while```, and ```for```.

## if Statement
It is used to execute an instruction or block of instructions only if a condition is fulfilled. Its form is:

```C++
if (condition)
  statement
```
where *condition* is the expression that is being evaluated. If this condition is true, statement is executed. If it is false, statement is ignored (not executed) and the program continues on the next instruction after the conditional structure. 

```C+++
if (x == 100)
  cout << "x is 100";
  
// If we want more than a single instruction to be executed in case that condition is true we can specify a block of instructions using curly brackets { }: 
if (x == 100)
 {
  cout << "x is ";
  cout << x;
 }
 ```
 > *Evaluation of an expression to true in C++ essentially means that the expression does not evaluate to false, false being zero. So, an expression that evaluates to any non-zero
   number—negative or positive—is essentially considered to be evaluating to true when used in a conditional statement.*

### if-else
We can additionally specify what we want if the condition is not fulfilled by using the keyword else.

```C++
if (condition)
{
    // condition success block
    Statement 1;
    Statement 2;
}
else
{
   // condition failure block
   Statement 3;
   Statement 4;
}
```
### Nested-if
Often we are faced with situations where we need to validate against a host of different conditions, many of which are dependent on the evaluation of a previous condition. C++
allows us to nest if statements to handle such requirements. Nested if statements are similar to this:

```C++
if (expression1)
{
    DoSomething1;
    if (expression2)
        DoSomething2;
else
    DoSomethingElse2;
}

else
    DoSomethingElse1;
```

### if - else-if
`if else-if` construct can be used as a three way decision making statement or when it is necessary to check multiple conditions

```C++
if (expression1)
    DoSomething1;
else if (expression2)
    DoSomethingElse1;
else
    DoSomethingElse2;
```

## switch
Its purpose is to check for a value among a number of possible constant expressions. It is something similar to concatenating if-else statements, but limited to constant expressions. Its most typical syntax is:

```C++
switch (expression)
{
  case constant1:
     group-of-statements-1;
     break;
  case constant2:
     group-of-statements-2;
     break;
  .
  .
  .
  default:
     default-group-of-statements
}
```
It works in the following way: switch evaluates expression and checks if it is equivalent to constant1; if it is, it executes group-of-statements-1 until it finds the break statement. When it finds this break statement, the program jumps to the end of the entire switch statement (the closing brace). If expression was not equal to constant1, it is then checked against constant2. If it is equal to this, it executes group-of-statements-2 until a break is found, when it jumps to the end of the switch. Finally, if the value of expression did not match any of the previously specified constants (there may be any number of these), the program executes the statements included after the default: label, if it exists (since it is optional).

### Switch fall through
If the example above lacked the break statement after the first group for case one, the program would not jump automatically to the end of the switch block after printing x is 1, and would instead continue executing the statements in case two (thus printing also x is 2). It would then continue doing so until a break statement is encountered, or the end of the switch block. This makes unnecessary to enclose the statements for each case in braces {}, and can also be useful to execute the same group of statements for different possible values. For example:
	
```C++
switch (x) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    cout << "x is 1, 2 or 3";
    break;
  default:
    cout << "x is not 1, 2 nor 3";
  }
```

Notice that switch is limited to compare its evaluated expression against labels that are constant expressions. It is not possible to use variables as labels or ranges, because they are not valid C++ constant expressions.

> Switch-case constructs are well-suited to being used with enumerated constants.

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  enum DaysOfWeek
  {
     Sunday = 0,
     Monday,
     Tuesday,
     Wednesday,
     Thursday,
     Friday,
     Saturday
  };
  
  cout << “Find what days of the week are named after!” << endl;
  cout << “Enter a number for a day (Sunday = 0): “;
  
  int Day = Sunday; // Initialize to Sunday
  cin >> Day;
  
  switch(Day)
  {
    case Sunday:
    cout << “Sunday was named after the Sun” << endl;
    break;
    
    case Monday:
    cout << “Monday was named after the Moon” << endl;
    break;
    
    case Tuesday:
    cout << “Tuesday was named after Mars” << endl;
    break;
    
    case Wednesday:
    cout << “Wednesday was named after Mercury” << endl;
    break;
    
    case Thursday:
    cout << “Thursday was named after Jupiter” << endl;
    break;
    
    case Friday:
    cout << “Friday was named after Venus” << endl;
    break;
    
    case Saturday:
    cout << “Saturday was named after Saturn” << endl;
    break;
    
    default:
    cout << “Wrong input, execute again” << endl;
    break;
  
  }
  
  return 0;
}

## while
It's function is simply to repeat statement while expression is true. The loop has to end at some point, therefore, within the block of instructions (loop's statement) we must provide some method that forces condition to become false at some moment, otherwise the loop will continue looping forever.

```C++
while (expression)
  statement
```

## do-while
```C++
do
{
  statement;
} while(expression);
```

## for

its main function is to repeat statement while condition remains true, like the while loop. But in addition, for provides places to specify an initialization instruction and an increase instruction. So this loop is specially designed to perform a repetitive action with a counter.

It works the following way:

    1, initialization is executed. Generally it is an initial value setting for a counter varible. This is executed only once.
    2, condition is checked, if it is true the loop continues, otherwise the loop finishes and statement is skipped.
    3, statement is executed. As usual, it can be either a single instruction or a block of instructions enclosed within curly brackets { }.
    4, finally, whatever is specified in the increase field is executed and the loop gets back to step 2.

```C++
for (initialization expression; condition; update expression)
```
 The initialization and increase fields are optional. They can be avoided but not the semicolon signs among them. For example we could write: for (;n<10;) if we want to specify no initialization and no increase; or for (;n<10;n++) if we want to include an increase field but not an initialization.

Optionally, using the comma operator (,) we can specify more than one instruction in any of the fields included in a for loop, like in initialization, for example. The comma operator (,) is an instruction separator, it serves to separate more than one instruction where only one instruction is generally expected. For example, suppose that we wanted to intialize more than one variable in our loop:

    for ( n=0, i=100 ; n!=i ; n++, i-- )
    {
      // whatever here...
    }

### Range based for loop
```C++
for ( declaration : range ) statement;
```
This kind of for loop iterates over all the elements in range, where declaration declares some variable able to take the value of an element in this range. Ranges are sequences of elements, including arrays, containers, and any other type supporting the functions begin and end.

```C++
// range-based for loop
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
  string str {"Hello!"};
  for (char c : str)
  {
    cout << "[" << c << "]";
  }
  cout << '\n';
}
```

## Jump Statements
### break
break leaves a loop, even if the condition for its end is not fulfilled. It can be used to end an infinite loop, or to force it to end before its natural end.
// break loop example
#include <iostream.h>
int main ()
{
  int n;
  for (n=10; n>0; n--) {
    cout << n << ", ";
    if (n==3)
    {
      cout << "countdown aborted!";
      break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

### continue
The continue statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop in the current iteration, as if the end of the statement block had been reached, causing it to jump to the start of the following iteration.
/ break loop example
#include <iostream.h>
int main ()
{
  for (int n=10; n>0; n--) {
    if (n==5) continue;
    cout << n << ", ";
  }
  cout << "FIRE!";
  return 0;
}

## Unconditional branching with goto
goto allows to make an absolute jump to another point in the program. This unconditional jump ignores nesting levels, and does not cause any automatic stack unwinding. Therefore, it is a feature to use with care, and preferably within the same block of statements, especially in the presence of local variables.

The destination point is identified by a label, which is then used as an argument for the goto statement. A label is made of a valid identifier followed by a colon (:).

goto is generally deemed a low-level feature, with no particular use cases in modern higher-level programming paradigms generally used with C++.  

```C++
// goto loop example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
  int n=10;
mylabel:
  cout << n << ", ";
  n--;
  if (n>0) goto mylabel;
  cout << "liftoff!\n";
}
```
## The exit() function
```exit``` is a function defined in ```cstdlib (stdlib.h)``` library.
The purpose of exit is to terminate the running program with a specific exit code. Its prototype is:
```C++
void exit (int exit code); 
```
The exit code is used by some operating systems and may be used by calling programs. By convention, an exit code of 0 means that the program finished normally and any other value means an error happened.
