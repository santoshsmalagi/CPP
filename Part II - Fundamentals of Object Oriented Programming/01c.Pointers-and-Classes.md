## Pointers and Classes

To declare a pointer to a class object:

```
Class-Name *object-pointer = &class-object;

e.g. A aObj;
     A *aptr = &aObj;
```

A data member needs to be associated with an object, for it to be allocated memory space and hence have an address, defining a pointer to it does not make any sense. Therefore, to declare pointers to class members - i.e. class member pointers the ::* operator is used.

``` 
data-type Class-Name :: *class-member-pointer = &Class-Name::class-member;
e.g.  int A :: *nptr = &A::n;
```

There are two pointers to member operators:  .*  and  ->*.  

The .* operator is used to dereference pointers to class members. The first operand must be of class type. If the type of the first operand is class type T, or is a class that has been derived from class type T, the second operand must be a pointer to a member of a class type T, i.e.

```
object-name.*class-member-pointer
e.g. aObj.*nptr = 3;
```

The ->* operator is also used to dereference pointers to class members. The first operand must be a pointer to a class type. If the type of the first operand is a pointer to class type T, or is a pointer to a class derived from class type T, the second operand must be a pointer to a member of class type T, i.e.

```
object-pointer->*class-member-pointer
e.g. aptr->*nptr = 4;
```
 
Since the address of a static member is not associated with any particular object, normal pointers are used to access static data members. Normal pointers to class members can also be declared inside member functions. **However, the class themselves cannot include pointers to the data members**.  

These concepts are illustrated below:

```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class A
{

    public:
    int n;                                  // public non static data member
    static int count;                       // public static member
    int *np = &n;                           // illegal, class cannot have a pointer to member

    void getData()
    {
        int *nptrClass = &n;
        *nptrClass = 5;
        cout << "Accessing public member using a normal pointer inside a member function: " << *nptrClass << " Address: " << &nptrClass << "\n";
    }
};

int A::count;

int main()
{
    A aObj;                               // object of a class - class object
    A *aptr = &aObj;                      // pointer to the object of a class - object pointer
    int A :: *nptr = &A::n;               // class member pointer - pointer to the member of a class


    aObj.n = 1;
    cout << "Accessing public member using the class object: " << aObj.n << "\n";

    aptr->n = 2;
    cout << "Accessing public member using the object pointer: " << aptr->n << "\n";

    aObj.*nptr = 3;
    cout << "Accessing public member using object name and class member pointer: " << aObj.*nptr << " Address nptr: " << &nptr << "\n";

    aptr->*nptr = 4;
    cout << "Accessing public members using an object pointer and class member pointer: " << aptr->*nptr << "\n";

    aObj.getData();

    int *countPtr = &aObj.count;         //  to point to a static class member, use a normal pointer
    cout << "Accessing static member using the class object: " << aObj.count << "\n";
    cout << "Accessing static member using a normal pointer: " << *countPtr << "\n";
    cout << "Accessing static member using object pointer: " << aptr->count << "\n";

    return 0;
}

```

Similarly, to access private data members using pointers, this is possible from only within the member functions or *friend functions* of the class:

```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class A
{
    private:
    int n;
    static int count;

    public:

    void getData(int val)
    {
        int *np = &n;
        *np = val;
    }

    void putData()
    {
        int *np = &n;
        cout << "Private data member accessed using a normal pointer from inside a member function: " << *np << "\n";

        int *countPtr = &count;
        cout << "Private static data member accessed using a normal pointer from inside a member function: " << *countPtr << "\n";
    }

    friend void printData(A aObj);
};

int A::count = 10;

void printData(A aObj)
{
    A *aptr = &aObj;
    int A :: *nptr = &A::n;
    cout << "Private data member using the class object: " << aObj.n << "\n";
    cout << "Private data member using an object pointer: " << aptr->n << "\n";
    cout << "Private data member accessed using object name and class member pointer: " << aObj.*nptr << "\n";
    cout << "Private data member accessed using object pointer and class member pointer: " << aptr->*nptr << "\n";
}

int main()
{
    A aObj;
    aObj.getData(1);
    aObj.putData();
    printData(aObj);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Pointers to Member Functions

A pointer to a a member function can be declared as follows:

```
C++
return_type (class_name::*pointer_name) (parameter types);
pointer_name = &class_name::member_function_name;

e.g. void (A::*fptr)(int);
     fptr = &A::getData;
```

Alternatively both of these statements can be combined as follows:

```
return_type (class_name::*pointer_name) (parameter types) = &class_name::member_function_name;
e.g.  void (A::*fptr)(int) = &A::getData;
```

A function pointer is called using either of the two dereferencing operators (1) \*. operator with the object name, or (2) -> operator with an object pointer

```
return_type var = (object-name.*pointer_name)(arguments)
return_type var = (object-pointer->*pointer_name)(arguments)
```

The following example illustrated both these methods:
```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class A
{
    int m;

    public:
        void getData(int value) { m = value; }
        void putData(){cout << "Value m: " << m << "\n"; }
};

int main()
{
    A aObj;
    A *aptr = &aObj;

    void (A::*getDataptr)(int) = &A::getData;
    void (A::*putDataPtr)(void) = &A::putData;

    (aObj.*getDataptr)(1);
    (aptr->*putDataPtr)();

    return 0;
}
```

#### this pointer
```this``` is a reserved keyword applicable wihin the scope of a class that contains the address of an object i.e. value of ```this``` is ```&object-name```. When multiple objects of a class are created, each object gets its own copy of data members and all objects share a single copy of member functions. To correctly access and update the correct copy of the data member the compiler supplies an implicit ```this``` pointer along with each function call. The ```this``` pointer is passed as a hidden argument to all nonstatic member function calls and is available as a local variable within the body of all nonstatic functions. Situations when ```this``` pointer is used:


**1. Explicitly referring to the data member using this**  

```C++
# include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class A
{
    int m;
    public:
    void getData(int val);
    void putData();
};

void A::getData(int val)
{
    this->m = val;
}

void A::putData()
{
    cout << "Value of m: " << this->m;
}

int main()
{
    A aObj;
    aObj.getData(9);
    aObj.putData();
    return 0;
}
```

**2. Within a class, when a member function invokes another member then ```this``` pointer is passed as an implicit invisible parameter in the function call.**  

```C++
# include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class A
{
    int m;
    public:
    void getData(int val);
    void putData();
};

void A::getData(int val)
{
    m = val;
    putData();       // this pointer is implicitly passed
}

void A::putData()
{
    cout << "Value of m: " << m;
}

int main()
{
    A aObj;
    aObj.getData(9);
    return 0;
}
```

**3. Calling a member function from another member function using a pointer to the member**  
```C++
# include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class A
{
    int m;
    public:
    void getData(int val);
    void putData();
};

void A::getData(int val)
{
    m = val;
    void (A::*fptr)(void) = &A::putData;    // fptr is a class member pointer to putData()
    (this->*fptr)();                       // calls putData()

}

void A::putData()
{
    cout << "Value of m: " << m;
}

int main()
{
    A aObj;
    aObj.getData(9);
    return 0;
}
```

**4. Function Chaining Calls using this pointer**  

> ```this``` pointer is not sent to class methods declared as static, as they are not connected with object instances. Instead they are shared among all objects and called without any object using the class name.
